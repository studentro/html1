    <p>we live in an age where art is no longer defined by the physical medium.<p>
    <h2>mission statement<h2>
<p>my mission is to create a safe space for people to explore the culture of art made on and by computers<p>
    <h3>my goals <h3>
<p> my first goal is to inform the reader the reader about the beauty of art. my second
 goal is to inspire the reader to pursue there own artistic interests. my third goal is to share the joy of art.<p>
<p>the first site i tried to model mine after is known as onepagelove.com the website is very sleek and intuitive. 
the second website that I used for inspiration is the prada.com I really enjoy this websute its dramatic use of color that pulls the reader in<p>             
<p>the layout of my final website will include a brief paragraph at the beginning explaining to the reader the purpose of my website, it will
then transition into a decending slideshow of digital art with commentary by me enterpreting the piece.<p>
<p>I beleive my website will be enjoyable to people from all walks of life, from young people looking for new trends to the elderly making a valid attempt
to stay in the loop<p>
